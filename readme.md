This code/repo is not production ready...

## Install

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

I like and use Yarn :)

## Run the code

```bash
node app.js
```

This `app.js` code should:

- a `payer` and `receiver` file system wallets
- airdrop SOL to them
- create **TWO** new SPL tokens (`tokenA` and `tokenB`), owned by `payer`
- initialize a token swap pool for the two tokens
-

PS: The code will also save the certain files inside a `keys` folder that can make reusing and testing faster.
